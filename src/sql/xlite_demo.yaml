There's little Gollum waving hello or goodbye or something to The One Ring. Isn't it preciousssss? A big ol' snuggledy battle troll waits patiently to give out \"Free Hugs,\" and an Uruk-hai says \"o hai!\" over his shoulder. In the distance, there's Mount Doom with its explosion of lava (read: candy) and happy, puffy clouds of vog. Through the sky flies a friendly Nazgul on his Fell Beast (rawr!). The whole scene is watched over by the big, blinky eye of Sauron perched between the pinnacles of Barad-dûr. Face it. It's Mordorable.</p>\n<p>All the cuteness of Mordor is captured on this teal babydoll shirt. Fitted in juniors sizes.

The Sisters at Radiant Farms have dedicated their lives to nursing these elegant creatures through their final days. Taking a cue from the Kobe beef industry, they massage each unicorn's coat with Guinness daily and fatten them on a diet comprised entirely of candy corn. As the unicorn ages, its meat becomes fatty and marbled and the living bone in the horn loses density in a process much like osteoporosis. The horn's outer layer of keratin begins to develop a flavor very similar to candied almonds. Blending the crushed unicorn horn into the meat adds delightful, crispy flavor notes in each bite.

Refined over millions of years of evolution, it's a highly specialized and effective organ that helps us hunt prey, spot berries, and notice and dodge swinging clubs. As humanity continued to evolve, however, we relied more on the tools we manufactured rather than the ones with which we were born.<br /><br />Now we have more so-called \"knowledge-workers\" than ever, spending all day tied to desks, and staring at computer screens. We've traded sore backs and calluses for headaches and dry and tired eyes. You rub your eyes, and drip drops into them, but that doesn't really help, does it?<br /><br />You see, high-efficiency fluorescent lighting and computer monitors in our offices are highly shifted towards the blue-end of the spectrum. The problem is, blue light focuses differently on the retina than the rest of the spectrum. Ever look at a blue LED and noticed a halo around the light? Staring at it gives you a headache, doesn't it? Guess why! Your eyes are straining to try and bring that fuzzy spot into focus, and they just can't!<br /><br />What you need is a way to filter out some of those blues that give your eyes so much trouble. With amber lenses, Gunnar Computer Glasses shift that light to the warmer end of the spectrum, giving your tired eyes a chance to recover. Not only do they filter blue light, they also reduce glare, helping with eye strain even more.<br /><br />Be more productive, working longer and harder than the other guys, and maybe you'll get that promotion before Doofus McDumbPants across the hall does.
